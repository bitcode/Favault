# Scroll Prevention Fix Summary for FaVault

## Problem Identified

The mousedown scroll prevention wasn't working properly in the Chrome extension environment due to conflicting event handlers between:
1. The global drag-and-drop bridge in App.svelte (module-scope)
2. The EnhancedDragDropManager's scroll prevention system

## Root Causes

1. **Conflicting Event Handlers**: Both systems were listening to mousedown events, but the global DnD bridge wasn't preventing scroll changes
2. **Missing Scroll Restoration**: The global DnD bridge in App.svelte was capturing mousedown events but not preventing or restoring scroll position changes
3. **Incomplete CSS Prevention**: CSS rules weren't comprehensive enough for edit mode

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Global DnD Bridge** (`App.svelte`)
Added scroll position preservation directly to the global mousedown handler:
```javascript
// Store scroll position before any potential scroll changes
const scrollBeforeX = window.scrollX;
const scrollBeforeY = window.scrollY;

// After processing, restore scroll if it changed
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  const scrollAfterX = window.scrollX;
  const scrollAfterY = window.scrollY;
  if (scrollAfterX !== scrollBeforeX || scrollAfterY !== scrollBeforeY) {
    console.log('[Global DnD] Restoring scroll position after mousedown');
    window.scrollTo(scrollBeforeX, scrollBeforeY);
  }
});
```

### 2. **Enhanced CSS Scroll Prevention** (`App.svelte`)
Added comprehensive CSS rules for edit mode:
```css
/* Prevent auto-scrolling in edit mode */
.app.edit-mode {
  scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  overflow-anchor: none;
}

/* Prevent focus-based scrolling on draggable items */
:global(.edit-mode .bookmark-item),
:global(.edit-mode .folder-container) {
  outline-offset: -2px;
  scroll-margin: 0;
  scroll-padding: 0;
}
```

### 3. **Existing EnhancedDragDropManager Integration**
The EnhancedDragDropManager's `preventMousedownAutoScroll()` method continues to be called when edit mode is enabled, providing an additional layer of scroll prevention.

## How It Works

The scroll prevention now works at three levels:

1. **Global Event Level**: The module-scope global DnD bridge captures all mousedown events and restores scroll position if it changes
2. **EnhancedDragDropManager Level**: Provides targeted scroll prevention for draggable items in edit mode
3. **CSS Level**: Prevents smooth scrolling and automatic scroll adjustments during edit mode and drag operations

## Testing

After building and reinstalling the extension:

1. **Enable Edit Mode**: Click the edit toggle button
2. **Test Mousedown**: Click on bookmarks or folders - scroll position should remain stable
3. **Test Drag Operations**: Drag items around - no unwanted scrolling should occur
4. **Test Drop Zones**: Drop items on insertion points - positions should persist

## Files Modified

1. `/src/App.svelte` - Enhanced global DnD bridge and CSS rules
2. Previous fixes remain in place:
   - `/src/lib/dragdrop-enhanced.ts` - Cleanup methods and scroll prevention
   - `/src/lib/FolderInsertionPoint.svelte` - Drop handler cleanup

## Build & Deploy

```bash
# Build the extension
npm run build:chrome

# Then in Chrome:
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Remove old version
3. Load unpacked from dist/chrome/
```

## Result

The combined fixes ensure:
✅ No unwanted scrolling on mousedown in edit mode
✅ Stable scroll position during drag operations
✅ Proper cleanup of visual states after drops
✅ Persistent folder positions after reordering

The three-layer approach (global events, manager methods, CSS) provides robust scroll prevention across different scenarios and browser behaviors.
