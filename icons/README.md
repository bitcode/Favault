# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

For now, placeholder icons will be created programmatically during the build process.
In a production environment, you should replace these with professionally designed icons.
